# Accessibility refactor

## Description

This page was refactored in order to have better search engine optimization.  I added new tags that are semantic to the html code.  The style sheet was only moved around, new style commands were not added.  

The project was a challenge as I am a new coder.  After many attempts I was able to make changes that did not change the look of the site.  The main issues I ran across were minor typos that made a huge difference.  

This is not complete by anymeans.  I am sure there are many thins that could be added to make it even better, given more time and more knowledge.  However this is the first time I have done anuything like this and am very pleased with the result. Mainly it looks in the browser how it did when I got it!

## Instalation

I have not idea how to do that with this and if you need to but want to practice doing a full README

## Usage

Not sure what to put here either

## Credits

I used the repo file from my school program through DU.

## License

I have no idea what kind of license this page would have.  Probably the close to the orinigal one as I did not make it but rather added to it.
